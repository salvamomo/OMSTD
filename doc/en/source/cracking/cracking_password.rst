CH-001: Cracking: GPUs + CPU (TODO)
===================================

Problem
-------

Cracking in cluster mode and in parallel

Solution
--------

Create dictionaires and send processing blocks to nodes that test those blocks. The nodes can be remote or local.

With this method we achieve: GPUs + CPUs + old PCs + net -> **Win**!

Implementation
--------------
