HH-001: Net sniffing (TODO)
===========================

.. _hh-001:

Problem
-------

Is not trivial to interpret net protocols, analyse them and store results, to then perform a datamining session in order to fetch key information.

Building a well designed, efficient and scalable project is key for that matter.

Solution
--------

Sniffing of net protocols with the proper libraries:
- Rip
- Web
- Telnet
- DHCP
- ...

Put in place an unattended, real-time system.

Implement an abstraction with the storage systems, with the goal of reaching scalability and portability.

Implementation
--------------
